# Simple-youtube-download
A simply python script for fast downloading of youtube videos in either mp3 or mp4

**I made this script because I was tired of having to type out the commands for downloading youtube videos for archival purposes.**

## Installation instructions
Make sure to you have yt-dlp installed
```
pip install yt-dlp
```
and make sure to download [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and extract the contents of the bin folder into the directory with download.py

**And you're finished!**

*You can also make a shortcut of download.bat on your desktop for ease of use*
